### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name's Rob

#### Iâ€™m an experienced press officer making a career change from public relations to software development.

Iâ€™ve got a passion for problem-solving and learning new technologies, with a slight obsession with linear gradients.

In my spare time, I host a podcast for developers by developers called Codewords. It's an informal coffee chat with code newbies, senior engineers and more.

If Iâ€™m not at my desk youâ€™ll find me cycling or taking on a hiking trail.

Skills: HTML | CSS | JavaScript | SQL | Docker
