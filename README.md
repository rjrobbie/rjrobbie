### Hi there, I'm Rob ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an experienced press officer making a career change from public relations to software development. 

Iâ€™ve got a passion for problem-solving and learning new technologies, with a slight obsession with linear gradients.

In my spare time, I host a podcast for developers by developers called Codewords. It's an informal coffee chat with code newbies, senior engineers and more.    

If Iâ€™m not at my desk youâ€™ll find me cycling or taking on a hiking trail.
